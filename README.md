# Advent of Code 2023

For this year's AoC I've decided of the following strategy:
Every day I'll solve the puzzle in a random language from the following list:
- C
- C++
- Rust
- FASM
- OCaml.

There's one additional rule: two subsequent days mustn't be solved in the same language. If you get the same language as the previous day, run the program again until you get a different language.

## How to use
### Select a random language

Compile the selection:
```sh
make selection
```
Run the selection:
```sh
bin/selection
```

### Solve a puzzle from a particular day
Compile and run:
```sh
make dayX 
```
where $X \in [1, 25]$

| Language | Solutions |
|----------|-----------|
| C        |         3 |
| C++      |         2 |
| Rust     |         3 |
| FASM     |         3 |
| OCaml    |         3 |
